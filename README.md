# README

This is a collection of code challenges I had to develop for interviews, "fun" or because I was testing something before applying the final solution to a production environment for companies I worked for. 

I copied/pasted the challenge description found on the website or given by the interviewer in most of the cases, so I'm sorry if something can be inaccurate.

## Notes

- Developed using Ruby 3.1.4. I might be possible that a few core methods won't work on versions older than Ruby 3.
- You'll see in all the files, that I've added a custom BenchmarkHelper module. It's not important for the single challenge, but I've added it just because in some cases I needed to compare the execution time with other languages.
- Most of the cases you'll see the Benchmark is close to the 0ms, but it's just because I only added the test cases given by the interviewer/website. When the performance was important for me, I added some custom test cases to better test the load.
